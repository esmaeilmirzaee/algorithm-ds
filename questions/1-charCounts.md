# Number of characters inside a string variable

## Question

The question is as simple as count the number of characters inside a string variable.

```python
# sample output
{
  'a': 1,
  's': 2,
}
```

## Solution

1. In this sectin, we implement the most rudimentary algorithm to count the number of characters.

2. We can store the result inside the hash so our implementation could be smooth and space efficient.

3. In this implementation, we use all the available language specific functions and tricks to take advantage of the language.
